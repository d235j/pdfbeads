2010 November 7 (Alexey Kryukov) Version 1.0.0

    * Initial release

2010 November 12 (Alexey Kryukov) Version 1.0.1

    * JBIG2 support didn't work properly under MS Windows.

2010 November 15 (Alexey Kryukov) Version 1.0.3

    + Make it possible to specify binarization threshold for mixed scans
      (it is still not recommended to perform segmentation with pdfbeads,
      unless the image has been previously processed with ScanTailor, so
      the normal value for this parameter is 1).

    * If a multipage TIFF file is passed to pdfbeads, warn user that
      only the first image will be processed.

    * TIFF files with an embedded EXIF block were incorrectly processed
      by ImageInspector.

2012 February 4 (Alexey Kryukov) Version 1.0.5

    * If JPEG2000 compression was requested but not available,
      JPEG files were still written with the 'JP2' extension.

    * Some tweaks to minimize the effect of page labels being inconsistently handled
      in various PDF viewers (prefer ISO-8859-1 strings if possible).

2012 February 5 (Alexey Kryukov) Version 1.0.6

    + Add Greek letters (the monotonic set) to the list of characters with hardcoded
      glyph names and width.

    * Minor bugs fixed.

2012 February 10 (Alexey Kryukov) Version 1.0.7

    + An attempt to achive better positioning of the hidden text layer, taking into
      account not just lines, but also individual words. This should work with hOCR
      files produced with Cuneiform or Tesseract.

2012 March 5 (Alexey Kryukov) Version 1.0.8

    Palette colors in PNG images were treated as signed chars and this could cause
    indexed images to be incorrecty displayed in the resulting PDF.
