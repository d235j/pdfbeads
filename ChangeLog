2010 November 15 (Alexey Kryukov) Version 1.0.3

    + Make it possible to specify binarization threshold for mixed scans
      (it is still not recommended to perform segmentation with pdfbeads,
      unless the image has been previously processed with ScanTailor, so
      the normal value for this parameter is 1).

    * If a multipage TIFF file is passed to pdfbeads, warn user that
      only the first image will be processed.

    * TIFF files with an embedded EXIF block were incorrectly processed
      by ImageInspector.

2012 February 4 (Alexey Kryukov) Version 1.0.5

    * If JPEG2000 compression was requested but not available,
      JPEG files were still written with the 'JP2' extension.

    * Some tweaks to minimize the effect of page labels being inconsistently handled
      in various PDF viewers (prefer ISO-8859-1 strings if possible).
